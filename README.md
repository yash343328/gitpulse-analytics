# GitPulse — Premium GitHub Analytics

GitPulse turns any GitHub username into a beautiful, interactive analytics dashboard:
commit activity, language breakdowns, growth trends, repository health scores, pull
requests, issues, releases, organizations, and more — all rendered client-side with
zero backend required.

Developed by **Yash Jain**.

## 🛠 Tech stack

- React 18 + Vite
- React Router v6
- Tailwind CSS (custom design tokens, glassmorphism, gradients)
- Recharts (pie / bar / line charts)
- jsPDF + jspdf-autotable (PDF export)
- Native GitHub REST API (no GraphQL, no backend)

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. (Optional) configure a GitHub token to raise the API rate limit
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx

# 3. Run the dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Build for production
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The app runs entirely in the browser. Without a token, GitHub allows 60 unauthenticated
API requests per hour per IP; with a personal access token (no scopes required for
public data) that rises to 5,000/hour. GitPulse caches every request for 5 minutes in
both memory and `localStorage` to minimize calls, and shows a clear message if the
rate limit is ever hit.

## 🔒 Privacy

from your browser to `api.github.com`. Search history, favorites, and preferences are
stored only in your browser's `localStorage`. See the in-app Privacy Policy for details.
